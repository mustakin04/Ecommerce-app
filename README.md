2)Product Detail Page: Shows full details for each product, including description and price.

3)Cart Sidebar: A slide-in sidebar showing selected items with quantity controls and total cost.

4)Checkout Modal: Popup form to collect user details (Name, Email, Address) and simulate order placement.

6)SPA Navigation: Built with React Router for seamless client-side routing.
